## Pointers with Git:

1) When making changes, create and switch to new branch with name relating to the change (git checkout -b <branch_name> )
2) Finish your changes, and add and commit the file.
3) Then git push the new branch to github (git push -u origin <branch_name>)
4) Then review the new branch, submit a pull request and compare new branch with master, and approve it if no conflicts.
5) Then other members can git pull the changes.
 
This way a working model will be preserved in master.
